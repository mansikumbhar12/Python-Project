# Zomato Data Analysis Using Python
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Zomato restaurant data to extract meaningful insights about dining preferences, online and offline ordering trends, cost patterns, and restaurant ratings, and to understand customer behavior across different restaurant categories.
## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
* name: Name of the restaurant
* online_order: Indicates if the restaurant accepts online orders
* book_table: Indicates if the restaurant provides table booking services
* rate: Average rating of the restaurant
* votes: Number of votes received for the restaurant
* approx_cost(for two people): Approximate cost for two people
* listed_in(type): Type of the restaurant (e.g., dining, café)
## Zomato Analysis
This project utilizes the following Python libraries to analyze and visualize the data:
* Numpy: For handling complex numerical computations efficiently.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and creating structured data frames for analysis.
* Matplotlib: For creating visualizations such as plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
* Seaborn: For creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
## Questions
* Which category of restaurants is the most common?
* Do customers prefer dining restaurants or cafés?
* What is the trend for online orders?
* What are the average ratings of restaurants?
* What is the preferred cost range for couples?
* How do offline orders compare to online orders in terms of ratings?
* What ordering preferences are observed across dining and café categories?
## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that the majority of the restaurants fall into the dining category, which is preferred by a larger number of individuals. A significant portion of restaurants do not accept online orders, and most restaurants have ratings ranging between 3.5 and 4. Additionally, couples tend to prefer restaurants with an approximate cost of 300 rupees for two people. The analysis also shows that offline orders generally receive lower ratings compared to online orders, which tend to receive excellent ratings. Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, while cafés mostly rely on online orders. This suggests that customers prefer in-person ordering at dining restaurants, while online ordering is favored for cafés.
